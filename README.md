# Insect-adaptation
Criteria for usable data:
  - at least two individuals of the same species from the same collection site (most limiting) 
  - had a known location
  - had a measurement for BDT 
Important Variables:
  - BDT.C/BDT_Dist = base development temperature/ distance from base development temperature
  - LT/LT_Dist = total larval development temperature' "  " total larval development temperature
  - lat_new = updated latitudinal locations
